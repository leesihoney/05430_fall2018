HTML Web Storage

localStorage: no expiration
    localStorage.setItem("name","Teru")
    localStorage.getItem("name")





Storing Objects in Web Storage (localStorage only stores string)

    JSON = "JavaScript Object Notation", Makes it easy to store and send JavaScript Objects

    var cat = { name:: "Teru", weight: 10, age: 1.5}

    localStorage.setItem("myCat", JSON.stringify(cat))
    JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("myCat"));


Issues with Client-Side Storage

Good for quick accerss, however,
     - Limited Space

Server-Side Storage
    - Database Management System (MySQL, MongoDB)
